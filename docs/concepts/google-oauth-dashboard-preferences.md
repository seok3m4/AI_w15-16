## What Was Applied

- Google OAuth2 login is exposed at `/oauth2/authorization/google`.
- The Google OAuth callback URI is explicitly configurable with `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`.
  If it is not set, Spring uses `{baseUrl}/login/oauth2/code/{registrationId}`
  so the callback is derived from the incoming backend request instead of being
  hard-coded to localhost. CloudFront deployments should still set
  `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://<cloudfront-domain>/login/oauth2/code/google`
  explicitly unless the distribution forwards enough viewer protocol/host
  information for Spring to derive the CloudFront URL.
- After a successful web login, Spring Security redirects to `${FRONTEND_BOARD_URL:http://localhost:5173/home}`.
- Google user profile data is upserted into `app_users` by provider and provider user id.
- Google OAuth success now issues the same `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `REFRESH_TOKEN`, and
  `XSRF-TOKEN` cookies as email/password login before redirecting to the frontend.
  This keeps frontend API authentication consistent instead of depending only on
  the Spring OAuth session cookie surviving through CloudFront and ALB.
- Login-time profile persistence and request-time user lookup are intentionally separated:
  `PersistingOAuth2UserService` refreshes the Google profile during OAuth login, while
  `AppUserService.currentUser()` first reads an existing user and only creates one when
  it is missing. This keeps authenticated GET requests safe inside read-only
  transactions.
- `/api/me` now returns `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `avatarUrl`, and `provider`.
- Dashboard preferences are stored per user in `user_dashboard_preferences`.
- The preference API stores only display choices. Economic data still comes from `/api/us-economy/dashboard`.
- The frontend keeps `/home` public, adds `/mypage`, and filters home sections/items using saved preferences when a user is logged in.
- `visibleSections` is a required non-empty list for saved preferences. The frontend keeps at least one section selected, and the backend rejects an empty list with `400 Bad Request`.
- Home renders and exposes preference-aware sections only when `preferences.visibleSections.includes(...)` allows them. Hidden economic events, reports, and watchlist sections are also removed from the Home navigation.
- React logout uses `POST /api/logout`, which invalidates the Spring Security session and returns `204 No Content` for API-style handling.
- `NEWS_SEARCH_API_KEY` is not part of this flow.

## Why It Matters

- Anonymous users can still read the public economic dashboard.
- Logged-in users can personalize the dashboard without changing the shared economy data cache.
- OAuth profile storage gives the project a real user identity boundary without building a separate signup form.
- Keeping preferences as ID lists makes the feature small and resilient when the dashboard data changes.

## API Contract

- `GET /api/me`
  - Authenticated only.
  - Returns `username`, `email`, `displayName`, `avatarUrl`, and `provider`.
- `GET /api/users/me/dashboard-preferences`
  - Authenticated only.
  - Returns default preferences if the user has not saved preferences yet.
- `PUT /api/users/me/dashboard-preferences`
  - Authenticated only.
  - Request and response body:

```json
{
  "coreMetricIds": ["cpi", "unemployment"],
  "watchMetricIds": ["usd-krw"],
  "eventIds": ["cpi-release"],
  "reportIds": ["cpi-fred"],
  "visibleSections": ["core-metrics", "watchlist"]
}
```

- Allowed `visibleSections`: `core-metrics`, `economic-events`, `reports`, `watchlist`.
- Unknown section keys return `400 Bad Request`.
- Empty `visibleSections` returns `400 Bad Request`; defaults are returned only when a user has no saved preference record yet.
- Anonymous preference requests return `401 Unauthorized`.
- `POST /api/logout`
  - Authenticated API logout.
  - Returns `204 No Content`.
  - Invalidates the current server session and lets the React app clear local user/preference state.
- `GET /api/us-economy/dashboard` remains public.

## Frontend Call Path

- `front/src/api/backend.ts`
  - `getGoogleLoginUrl()`
  - `fetchCurrentUser()`
  - `logoutCurrentUser()`
  - `fetchDashboardPreferences()`
  - `saveDashboardPreferences()`
- `front/src/features/economy/pages/HomePage.tsx`
  - Fetches economy dashboard and current user.
  - Fetches preferences only when a user is logged in.
  - Filters core metrics, economic events, reports, and watchlist IDs on the client.
  - Uses `visibleSections` to conditionally render the core metrics, economic events, reports, and watchlist areas.
  - Removes hidden section workspaces from the Home navigation and sends direct hidden-section access back to Home with a personalization message.
  - Shows Google login when anonymous and a profile button when authenticated.
  - Shows a logout button when authenticated, then clears user and preference state after `POST /api/logout`.
- `front/src/features/profile/pages/MyPage.tsx`
  - Requires login.
  - Loads current dashboard items and saved preferences.
  - Saves section visibility and item selections through the preference API.
  - Disables the last checked visible-section checkbox so the saved configuration cannot become empty.

## Run Commands

- Backend tests: `cd backend; mvn test`
- Frontend lint: `cd front; npm.cmd run lint`
- Frontend build: `cd front; npm.cmd run build`
- Google OAuth local setup:
  - Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`.
  - Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
  - Configure the Google redirect URI as `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google`.
  - Leave `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` unset for the common local flow, or set it to
    `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/google` if you need an explicit value.
  - Keep `VITE_BACKEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:8080` so the frontend starts OAuth at the backend.
  - Do not set `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` to `http://localhost:5173/login/oauth2/code/google`; the React dev server cannot handle Spring's OAuth callback.
  - Start backend and frontend, then open `http://localhost:5173/home`.
- Google OAuth CloudFront setup:
  - Set `APP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://<cloudfront-domain>`.
  - Set `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://<cloudfront-domain>/login/oauth2/code/google`.
  - Configure the same HTTPS callback in Google Cloud Console.
  - Route `/oauth2/*` and `/login/oauth2/*` from CloudFront to the ALB with
    caching disabled and cookies/query strings forwarded, otherwise the OAuth
    state/session cannot survive the Google callback.

## Pitfalls And Follow-Ups

- The test-only local `user/password` login remains so existing security tests and local fallback keep working.
- Real Google login needs valid `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`; placeholder defaults only keep the app bootable.
- In CloudFront + ALB deployments, do not register an `http://` CloudFront callback in Google Cloud Console. Use the HTTPS CloudFront callback and keep `/login*` routed from CloudFront to the ALB.
- Do not let the deployed backend fall back to a localhost OAuth callback. The
  default is request-derived, but production should prefer an explicit
  `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` because CloudFront origin request policies may not pass
  the viewer `Host` header.
- In local development, a callback URL on port `5173` means the callback is going
  to Vite/React instead of Spring Security. The local callback must use backend
  port `8080`.
- OAuth success writes JWT cookies, but local account and Google account email
  conflicts are still intentionally blocked until a dedicated account-linking UX
  is implemented.
- Do not call profile upsert from read-only service methods such as board feed,
  notifications, preference reads, or Agent catalog reads. PostgreSQL enforces
  read-only transactions and will reject UPDATE statements from those paths.
- Preferences intentionally do not validate every metric/event/report id because the economy dataset changes over time.
- If an item id no longer exists in `/api/us-economy/dashboard`, the frontend silently excludes it.
- Alerts, news search, report subscriptions, and interest-indicator notifications remain follow-up scope.
